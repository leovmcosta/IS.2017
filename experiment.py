"""

This script shows an example of how to run a simple computational experiment. The research
question is as follows:

    What is the value of not moving, ie. not sending a fleet out, but letting your ships build up.

As a first step towards answering this question, we will make two assumptions:

    1) Players have two options: attack randomly, or don't move
    2) Players decide between these two entirely at random

Under these simplified circumstances, how often should players decide not to move? This is a simple question
to answer, we simply build rand bots for a range of parameters, and play a few games for each
combination. We plot the resulrts in a heat map
